## Now is the Hour




© 2016, 2022  by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com




 






When I finally located my High School pal, Hugh Railton in New Zealnd, in 2016, I recorded this in his honor.  It was in  a book of Maori Hymns  he gave me, at our Chaffey H.S. 10th Reunion. He got the prize for having come the farthest, by the way.  :)







It was one-take, no metronome track (obviously) Here it is, warts and all.
