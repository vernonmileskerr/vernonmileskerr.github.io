## Yin and Yang







©2014, 2018, 2023 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com 






    
    As do the Yin and Yang,
    
    The black and white,
    
    Of that ancient Asian dichotomy,
    
    So, also the antipodes of Human Nature
    
    Revolve in nauseating monotony:
    
    Sumos exchanging brooding glares before the lunge.
    
     
    
    The meth-addicted darkness
    
    Rolls its empty sockets at the creative surge of a symphony;
    
    The holocausts sidle up to a mother’s tender touch;
    
    An alleyway’s sodden sour garbage
    
    Rubs against the flash of insight from a Dickinson poem;
    
    A bombed-out Syrian  city’s collapse
    
    Echoes through a tranquil Kyoto temple-garden;
    
    The black tear of mourning
    
    swirls against the white tear of joy.
    
     
    
    Not that white could ever subsume black,
    
    Nor that both meld into dishwater gray…
    
    Nor that humanity could become pure light…
    
    But would that the black become ever grayer
    
    And the white stay white.
