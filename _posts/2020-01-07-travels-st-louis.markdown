# St. Louis

What on Earth can compare to the Arch?




No superlative is adequate.




Nothing prepares you for that first glimpse,




No travelogue, no picture in the Nat. Geo.




Soaring above the downtown skyscrapers,




Its satin-silver face reflects




The sky and clouds,




And the river,




That Old Man River.




Your first thoughts are




Who conceived this;




Who planned this;




Who approved it?




How many minds had to meld




For a city to accomplish this?




Millenia later archaeologists will theorize,




"Something significant happened here."




Yes, but not so much "Westward Expansion,"




But more:  human cooperation.




I stop at a signal light




And wait while a tidalwave of red-shirted fans




Crosses and flows toward Busch.




"Gotta support those Cards."




One senses in St. Louis




A spirit of community, of egalitarian concern




For everyone's pleasure, everyone's edification:




The famed Zoo has no admission fee




Neither does the Art Musum




Nor the Science Museum




There are even free seats at




Forrest Park's Summertime Opera.




When the project ends, [I head West on 70](http://vernonmileskerr.com/2020/11/20/travels-u-s-interstate-70/).




An elastic memory stretches out behind;




It won't break.




Someday it will yank me back to St. Louis.
