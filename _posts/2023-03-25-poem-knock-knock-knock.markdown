**KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK**

    KNOCK...
    KNOCK...
    KNOCK...
    DOC-trine...
    DOC-trine...
    DOC-trine...
    The sound of the lid
    Being nailed on the box
    Where God is kept,
    Safely managed,
    Bound and packaged,
    Simplified, 
    Demystified,
    Proprietized, 
    And monetized.
