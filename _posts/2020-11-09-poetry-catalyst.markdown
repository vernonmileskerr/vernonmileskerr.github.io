# Catalyst




© 2020 Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com






This morning before the sky lost black  
I stood beneath a half-pie moon  
With Orion and the dog star at my back  
And could not but pray thanks, to the Unknown God  
Who set this heavenly array on high —  
But then I relented, with a sigh,  
Remembering the forces long ago  
Which scientifically spread this show.







I stood awhile, still unconvinced  
Still filled with a tiny creature's awe  
At such apparent majesty —  
No matter how mundanely made.







Perhaps the miracle was not the making  
But the spark within this lizard-brain,  
The catalyst, that allows it to feel this awe  
And give the feeling an awe-spawned name:  
Beauty.
