When was there never blood?
There was ever blood.
From the moment of birth,
We are slathered in Mother's Blood.

From the dawn of our carnivority
We drew blood, we drank it, we danced upon it.

From the dawn of our tribalicity
We drew others' blood, we drank it, we danced upon it.

From the dawn of our religiosity
We poured out its sublimation, we drank it, we danced upon it—
Then, we went out and drew more, in its name.

There was ever blood.
We will never be without it.
Our economy depends upon spilling more of it.

There was ever blood.
Even when young cowered in their caves,
The masters of blood dragged them out,
Stuck the dagger in their hands,
And transported them to the killing fields.

Mother Earth is hungry for blood;
She will not be assuaged.
How do we escape Her?
