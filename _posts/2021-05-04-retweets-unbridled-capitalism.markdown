# Unbridled Capitalism




Here's another essay composed during my morning Twitter activity.  I personally can't think of a better remedy to save humanity than to — not do away with capitalism — but to politically _take charge_ and _set the agenda_ for capitalism. What many call "über-capitalism" or "super-capitalism" has effectively taken over American Politics thanks to the Supreme Court opinion in Citizens Uninted v. FEC. The only way to change that is by Constitutional Amendment — and that is being workerd on right now.  The best proposed Amendment in my opinion is the one being put forward by [MoveToAmend.org](http://MoveToAmend..org).  Their proposal does away with _not only "_money is free speech_" _but also the earlier and actually more damaging legal concrept of "corporations are persons." You can read the proposed amendment [on their site](http://movetoamend.org).




Here's my Twitter essay:

As part of a generation that's so old it has no name, I'm tired of pussyfooting around with you young Boomers, Gen X's, Millennials and all those other letters. Here's how it is: When you watch an enterprise get steadily less efficient, more rancorous within, more bloated in personnel, more spendthrift in utilizing its limited resources — you conclude what? Invest MORE in it — or sell-short? That's the planet Earth, kiddies. Where — pray tell — did the thrust to STOP the population-explosion go?







Why did China abandond it's One-Child-Only initiative and (seemingly) put out the aphrodisiacs? 







Well... Capitalism happened. Their own brand of Capitalism, for sure, but still the same old "capture-the-market-and- charge-through-the-nose" philosophy as the "West"has engaged in since the Rothschilds the Rockefellers, the Carnegies and the Morgans. Greater population means more serfs. It's the philosophy of,







<blockquote>"Yes, we've got to pollute the environment a bit, but hey, with the money we'll make, we don't have to live in those hell-holes called CITIES — and when we DO have to go to town, we can 'copter in, to the helipads on top of our penthouses."
> 
> </blockquote>







**Conclusion: **Throttle Capitalism. Put a governor on it. If your legislators won't get on the bandwagon, fire 'em and run yourself — or find someone who'll be a champion for humanity's continued existence. It won't happen under the current system. 







Don't worry about Gaia (Mother Earth). She'll recover — once we're gone. 







She always has.
