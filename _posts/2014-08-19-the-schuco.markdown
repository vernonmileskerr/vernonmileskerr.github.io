What was it about those little two-and-a-half-inch model racecars, with their quality German clockwork propulsion systems, that bring back such fond memories?

The clickety-click of winding the spring, then placing it inside a used automobile tire…

Putting it in gear with a clunk of the tiny shift lever…

Setting it free, watching it leap forward with an explosive burst of energy

As it climbs the wall and becomes a furiously whirring blur along the equator of that rubber torus…

Then watching it gradually slow, lose altitude, and come to a triumphant stop in the lower wall of the tire.

What was it about those Schucos?
