Here is a helpful and very much appreciated comment emailed to me by my old friend Manfred Wolf, who was my Critical Writing professor at San Francisco State.  Here are his comments:


-------------------------




"Vern's story 'The Haole' is gripping in its intensity and especially effective in showing a boy's infatuation with all things Hawaiian. Here the descriptions are lush and psychologically powerful. But the story turns very dark, and I found myself wishing that that change had been prepared for more carefully; we have many pages of idyll and very few of terror, which has a way of seeming to split the story in two."  -- Manfred Wolf
