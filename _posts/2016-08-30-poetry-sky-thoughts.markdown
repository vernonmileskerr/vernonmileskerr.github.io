**Sky Thoughts**

_© 2010, 2016 by Vernon Miles Kerr_

So, in the days of time gone by

The birdies sang and dusted the sky

With their feathery wings

While we kids watched and wished

That we could do the same.



We’d lay back in the clover scent

And argue about cloud pictures,

While a clock somewhere in the house

Ticked away the last seconds of summer.



And now, many summers away from there

My TV drones on, and the commercials shout

And the clock radio builds up steam

For tomorrow’s too-early rout

And the car stands like a crouching cat

Ready to spring upon the Interstate,

Where miles and miles unroll beneath the roaring tires.
