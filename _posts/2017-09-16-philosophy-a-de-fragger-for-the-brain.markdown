This is an email I recently sent to a longtime friend and mentor who is ethnically Jewish but
religiously atheistic

The _Pater Noster_ or _Our Father_ was simply a lesson by the rabbi Yeshua when his followers,
seeing the elaborate praying in public by the sect of the Pharisees, asked him, "How should your
followers pray?"  Basically the answer was, "Keep it simple, keep it in your own private room and
pray words to this effect,  'Our father, ...' "

cup of coffee today, in place of my morning meditation.

Shabbat Shalom,
