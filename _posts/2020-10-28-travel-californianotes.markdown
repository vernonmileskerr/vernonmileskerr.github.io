California and Texas have a few things in common. They're both big, both beautiful and both _could_ be—and actually, both used to be. _countries — r_epublics. Both have endless beaches, semi-tropical cities, a coldish North, world-class agriculture — along with mountains and deserts.
If you're planning a California vacation, you can't see it all in two weeks. But you can get a pretty good overview by driving one of several routes, from top to bottom. We're talking a 900 mile + journey (~1450 km). Whether it's a meandering 2-week trip, or one big gulp of 14 hrs, you'll get an idea of the scope and diversity of this country-within-a-country.
