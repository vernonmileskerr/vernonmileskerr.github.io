## Faith




###### ©2019 Vernon Miles Kerr, vernonmileskerr.com




There's  difference between Belief & Faith,




Faith is Gold. Belief is Smoke.




The religious have their core beliefs.




Whether strongly held or yet amorphous,




Whether strictly or lazily followed,




They are still... just beliefs.




Beliefs are tenuous, and untested,




Faith is forged in fire.




Though many claim it,




Faith cannot be professed —




But only demonstrated.




The atheist professes Faith in a Godless-Universe




But how many act on it near death's door?




"There are no atheists in a foxhole."




Peter professed Faith in Jesus




But denied him thrice.




Jesus, by his Faith in God's promise,




Though trembling and sweating blood,




Stepped up to be crucified.




Faith cannot be professed —




But only demonstrated.







But beware,




Faith can  be blind If ill-informed.




Financial ruin begins as mis-placed Faith.




"I took the plunge."




Indeed you did.




The dynamite-vested, acting on belief




Do not prove Faith.




Faith must be informed




Or Faith is Blind,




and mere Belief.
