# What If?

What if God purposely developed humans by evolution; giving us our physical drives to protect self, to reproduce, to form societies — blending us, hybridizing us from the many strains of ancestors — evolving us a little more, until the right moment in His plan: the moment he would add some of His own spirit-essence to this seemingly-incompatible platform? If that were the case, wouldn't God then live in every human being, even the most evil amongst us?




If a little bit of God lives in us, then even the most evil can choose to allow God's Spirit to flourish — through our minute-to-minute choices. We can choose what we know to be healthy for self and society by postponing the self-gratification that comes from satisfying each of our God-developed physical drives. In such a case, we wouldn't need a "messiah" to come to create Utopia. He would already be here, just waiting for His Spirit and Humanity to mutually flourish.
