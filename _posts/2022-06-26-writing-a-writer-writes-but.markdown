# A Writer Writes, But...



    
    ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com<br></br><br></br>






A writer writes, but a writer has to have something helpful to say.  And, even then, people won't listen unless they're entertained in the process. Most people won't.  A writer's body of work must be coherent. Mine isn't.  It's a mélange, a potpourri of the random thoughts of a perpetually wandering mind — a mind that ranges the Universe collecting trivia, like one of those hard-rubber "Ace" hair combs when held over tiny scraps of paper. My old friend, former critical-writing professor and mentor, [Manfred Wolf](http://www.survivalinparadise.com), says, "It's time you wrote a book." 







I scan my GoogleDrive, and my own voluminous blog (VernonMilesKerr.com) trying to find a coherent thread, something that could be tied together with a thesis and thus result in a book that's both helpful _and_ entertaining.  
I guess, one recurring theme is the negative impact of religion (generally) on the human story. With a sub-theme of how do you emancipate humans from the deeply inculcated, youthful brain-washing that nearly all of us get? How do you make such a serious and explosively sensitive subject — entertaining? A novel? What genre? Or just a big, long rambling look at the history of religions and their negative effect upon history — along with commentary. Nah, that would only help the scholarly. — _UNLESS_, you made it something like a Monty Python flick. Hmmmm…Am I onto something?  
In my opinion, "Religion," per se, wouldn't be half-bad if people wouldn't take it so seriously—_AND_ if they'd keep it in the privacy of their own homes. What do y'all think?
