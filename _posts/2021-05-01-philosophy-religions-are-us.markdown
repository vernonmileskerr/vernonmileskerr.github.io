# Religions Are Us




###### Â© 2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com






Sometimes, my creative-process begins as a multi-part tweet on Twitter.  Tweets under the hash-tag #FirstCupOfCoffee,  contain stuff that comes to me during morning meditation.  My first cup is for "the universe," which is the closest thing to saying "morning prayer" that I'm willing to venture.  Here are screen shots of a thread I created this morning, May Day 2021.
