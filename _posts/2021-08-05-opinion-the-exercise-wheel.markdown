# The Exercise Wheel




###### ©2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com  
Posted as a rough draft to Twitter August 5, 2021















I wonder if people in the real world, the one beyond Twitter, waste as much time as we do debating politics.  
Are we in some kind of rodent exercise wheel, that is hooked up to a figurative generator that empowers the big Twitter rodent wheel, that is hooked up to a huge BitCoin mining operation? I'm speaking figuratively here. 'Seems like we're being fed a story which hides how little choice we REALLY have in matters of governance: "A story told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing." 







Yes, the Dem Party seems the lesser of two evils — yet, as far as I'm aware, there has been NO movement by the Dems, to address or even acknowledge the need to Amend the Constitution to rectify Citizens United v. FEC and Santa Clara County v. SP Rwy Co. ("Money is Free Speech" and "Corporations are legal 'persons'," respectively) Before those chains of SCOTUS decisions, our legislators truly worked for "We the people." Now they work for monied interests who can support their unending, hugely expensive quest to get re-elected. 







And, yes the Dems have recently created a lot of "sound and fury" dealing with peripheral issues — the twigs, — while ignoring the trunk of the tree: The power of money over political policy-making. They are running in their own exercise wheel keeping us, the other rodents, focused on rancorous party politics, spinning up fear of losing the next election, so that the greater of two evils will not win the White House again. While we praise the Dems for all the recent activity, we become complacent about Citizens United, et al. Meanwhile both American political parties, kow-tow to those whose largess keeps this insane cycle of endless financially-burdensome campaigning alive and well. The Dems did a lot of talking about "Citizens" during the 2020 campaign. Now that they've won, their forgetfulness on this issue is telling.







Just keep talking politics on here, fellow Twit-wits, keep turning the exercise wheel, and I guarantee things won't change. Y'all must be happy with it. You certainly are quiet…
