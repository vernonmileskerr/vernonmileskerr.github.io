## The Plains of California




###### ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com





    
    Big gash on North America's face,
    Fully visible from space.
    Ohio with palm trees—
    Winter's Bowl of Foggy Frost
    Summer's scorchy slab of yellow grass
    And heat-shimmering vista of parallel rows of
    Orderly vineyard and orchard, diminishing to a point
    
    Old receptical for Dust Bowl Refugees,
    Older, pathway for Gold-thirsty zealots wielding pick and shovel, 
    Still older,  indigenous, riparian wanderers
    Rummaging along sinuous green traces of rivers 
    Across the yellow-brown flats
    While engulfed in wafting waves of wildflower scent.
    Still more ancient, Bed of an Inland Ocean
    Awaiting the Sea's return.
    And it will return,
    When this Ice Age completes.
