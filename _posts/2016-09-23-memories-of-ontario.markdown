Making preparations to attend my 55th High School reunion in Ontario, California, my memories of our school,  Chaffey High, spilled over into memories of Ontario in general.

A while back, I wrote a nostalgic piece about how Ontario was back in childhood days.  You can read it at the link below.

But I'm sure my memories are only the tip of the iceberg.  You who have spent time in Ontario could add so many more.  Please add your memories to the comments section below.  We can share them when we meet again.  :)

Cheers,

Vern
