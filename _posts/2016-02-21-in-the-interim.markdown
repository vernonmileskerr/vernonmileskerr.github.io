## In the Interim




###### © 2009, 2020 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com, WritersClass.net




In the interim 'tween dark and dark




We scrape,  we scratch, we endure—




Assuming import.




As that interim narrows to a slit




We scramble anxiously to gather




Shreds of legacy,




Scraps of relevancy,




Hoping they will live on




In the interim of others,




Until we remember,




Their interims




Are narrowing too.
