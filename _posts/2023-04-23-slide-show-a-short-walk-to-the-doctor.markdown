The infusion center where I get my chemotherapy sessions is only a mile from the hotel where I stay in Roseville, California.  These pictures document that little walk, taken on, a very rare, nice day, during the harsh Spring of 2023.  You can see that many of the wildflowers were bravely  poking their heads out, anyway.  Old Tom Turkey was also out with his harem, showing off, as Toms are want to do.
