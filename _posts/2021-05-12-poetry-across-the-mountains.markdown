# Across the Mountains




###### ©2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com




### 1949






Over the years, Mom and Pop had tried California,  







but something always drew them back East.







Maybe they pined for that slower pace, 







a less crowded place. 







But when I was six, back they came,







Spanning the Continental Divide, 







Several mountain ranges,







And a boring beating of desert, 







To bring us back to L.A. for good,







Thereafter, to a brittle dry life — 







With air sucked of moisture







By the undisturbed sun beating on the long Valley,













Braising all but the most stubborn dampness from it.







This was the new norm:  a life of empty, thin air, 







Unnoticed air — and unnoticed weather.







## 1962













Top o' Millstone Avenue in Santa Maria,







Pop, from his pulpit at the kichen table







Over coffee, between pulls from  his pipe —







Or those evil, dark cigarettes —







Spinning sermonettes of Oklahoma youth:













Hunting, fishing, swimming 







In favorite swimming holes —







Ignoring the water moccasins,







Being immune to poison ivy —







Some kind of truce with nature.







It sounded so very far away and so long ago.







## 1968







Married, visiting relatives in Oklahoma.







Now it was real,













That first night, 







Unremembered-humidity 







Soaking wet sheets







Limp curtains in front of open windows







Unceasing  rasping buzz of some insect







Dominating strangely fuzzy-velvet night air —







Cicadas. What are those? 













Sleep intermittant..







## 2012













Away from the Plains a few years; 







Pulling into the parking lot in Indy







Tires hot from the drive across the mountains,







Opening the car door







Feeling eveloped in deep, soft humidity.







Ears assaulted by raspy cicada-racket.







While a siilent firefly streaks in the woods,







Feeling  joy.







It's anohter world







Across the mountains.
