### Life Is…


© 2017 Vernon Miles Kerr



Life is a flute of champagne.

We are the twinkling bubbles

Streaming upward,

Spattering into oblivion at the top.

We are born,

We rise through life’s events

Then we burst.

Gone.

Nothing.

But new bubbles always replace us,

For the moment.



Life is the tip of an ancient wave

In an ocean with no known shores.

How it started and where it crashes

No one knows.

Its lip is all the life that is

Its wake is all the life that was.



When all that is becomes all that was

The wave will be gone,

Along with anyone to remember it.
