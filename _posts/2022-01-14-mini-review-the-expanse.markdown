# The Expanse, a Review




###### ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com - Originally posted as a rough-draft to Twitter on 1/14/2022









As a die-hard [#trekkie](https://twitter.com/hashtag/trekkie?src=hashtag_click), I cannot _stand_ to even be in the room when [#TheExpanse](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheExpanse?src=hashtag_click) is being watched. The StarTrek franchise portrays a _hopeful_ tomorrow, a humanity striving to positively interact with, and understand the Universe. 







The Expanse on the other hand, is a gritty portrayal of a human-inhabited solar system where the very worst and very ugliest of today's world is "infecting," rather than positively interacting with the Universe?  Am I a "snowflake," for being depressed by it?







The Expanse's tagline is: 







"In the 24th century, a group of humans untangle a vast plot which threatens the Solar System's fragile state of detente " 







Dear God, please, please, tell me that in 300 years, humanity will have evolved socially into a much less ugly and less violent species than _this_—and that we will enjoy a much more hopeful state of existence than mere... "detente."[](https://t.co/016CL4bhQW)
