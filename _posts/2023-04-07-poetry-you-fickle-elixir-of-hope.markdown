## You, Fickle Elixir of Hope







Â© 2023 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com






    
    Bitterly delicious blower-away of morning groggy,
    Elixir, layering hope upon hopeless thoughts,
    Possiblities upon a sea of doubts:
    Why do you not stay longer?
    Would that medical science 
    Create a timed-release version of you
    So that my heart and mind could.
    At all moments, be normal.
