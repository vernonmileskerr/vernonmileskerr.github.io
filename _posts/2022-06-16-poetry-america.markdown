# #AMERICA

    #AMERICA 
    Her land is gorgeous
    Beyond comprehension.
    Her people are generous,
    Casual, & witty.
    But her politics are bombastic
    Self important and ugly.
    Her government—conceived
    A comforting facilitator,
    Creator of opportunites—
    Has become a hovering
    Dreaded, slavemaster.
