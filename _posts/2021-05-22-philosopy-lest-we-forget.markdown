# Lest We Forget our Origins

### Caution, Construction Zone.  Ongoing editing in process.  :)






No individual human is very far removed from the little primate bands of our ancestors, which were probably much like those of modern-day Gorillas, Bonobos, and Chimpanzees — social creatures whose very survival depends upon successful collaboration.  We're just monkeys. 







It's not a new idea.  Darwin proposed it in 1859 and it launched a century of rancorous debate between religiosity and science.  It's not new, but studying today's primates is a very effective way to learn both the good and the bad of being a social creature:  all of the materialistic, religious, political, and other bullshit variables are removed — leaving only the important basics. The sharing, the grooming, the play are easily constrasted with the squabbles, the theft of prized delicacies, and even the fights resulting in death.
