## The Heavenly Vintner






    
    ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com






    
    Old Mother Earth is a Prime Vintage
    Having aged in the black dark cellar of space
    For billions of years, undisturbed,
    Except for ocasional riddling by asteroids and comets.
    
    At some long-planned moment the Vintner opened the bung
    And added a catalytic ingredient — us.
    Did the Vinter know whether this addition
    Would enhance — or taint?
    Produce a fine savor — or vinegar?
    
    One, eternal and immune to time, should know,
    If not know,  at least — extrapolate.
    Does the Vintner suspend prescience,
    For the delight of surprise?
    
    Perhaps He has other vintages 
    Aging in their own  dark cellars.
    Maybe some were released aeons before ours.
    How did they fare?
    How will Mother Earth fare?
    
    Unlike mindless natural catalysts
    We can chose whether to enhance or taint.
    The Vinter awaits.
    Will Mother Earth's fate  be the Hevenly Land-fill
    Or an Honored spot in the Vinter'a personal rack?
