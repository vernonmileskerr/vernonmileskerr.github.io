## Entropy


© 2017 Vernon Miles Kerr




#### The First Law of Thermodynamics:


The increase in the internal energy of a system is equal to the amount of energy added by heating the system, minus the amount lost as a result of the work done by the system on its surroundings.


#### The Second Law of Thermodynamics:


"In a system, a process that occurs will tend to increase the total entropy of the universe."


#### The Third Law of Thermodynamics:


The [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) of a perfect [crystal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal) at [absolute zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero) is exactly equal to zero.*


### 1.


Entropy: the system’s heat

I cannot reach,

Useless energy

Whose fate is to deteriorate,

And drag the system down

To a quiescent state.


### 2.


But that which is quiescent,

Eventually quakes.

Entropy borrowed from elsewhere

Brings mountains down

To quiescent rubble.

It dictates the fate of everything tactile,

The Jenga tower’s inherent future

Before its inevitable collapse.



Entropy commands

That which is organized, to chaotic-ize.

That which is hot, to cool.

That which is cool to freeze.

That which is frozen, to melt.

That which has melted, to sublimate.

That which spins, to devolve to a stop.

That which is tall, to topple.

That which has toppled, to decay.



That which is planned, to surprise.

That which is permanent, to alter.

That which is worshipped, to disappoint.

That over which we obsess, to later bore.

That which is trustworthy, to lie.

That which is beloved, to die.


### 3.


But that which is true, is ever,

And that Love which is true, knows not

Entropy.
