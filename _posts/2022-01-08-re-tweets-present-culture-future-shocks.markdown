# Present Culture-Future Shocks




###### © 2022 Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com - Posted in rough-draft to Twitter on 1/8/22






Fair-warning, this'll be a rather cynical piece. I was thinking this morning, "The world is so screwed up, with so many religions, so many philosophies, so many political parties, so many cultures competing for the spotlight, the chaos can only get worse."







This is the world described by Toffler's 1970 "Future Shock," but even _exacerbated_ by the sudden explosion of communications and travel—with its involuntary confrontation between people of dissimilar backgrounds, described by Oberg as "Culture Shock." I don't look for it to get better any time soon.  Such a suddenly made zip-file probably takes a few centuries, or at least a few generations to unpack.
