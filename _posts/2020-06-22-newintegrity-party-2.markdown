[VernonMilesKerr.com](https://vernonmileskerr.com)  is hosting this page, to be used for discussion in line with this simple mission statement:_**"Bring integrity to American politics;  and eliminate "tribal" thinking and tribal-methods from the American political process."  **_Even this mission statement is open to discussion — even the idea of _using_ a new, 3rd American political party to achieve that goal, is open to discussion.
