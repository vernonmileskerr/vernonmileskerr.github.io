My "quiet time" this morning was on the subject of DIY.
No, not home-improvement projects, but #Art.

Before humans enslaved each other in the Agriculture Industry, Art was collaborative. We sat around the fire  after our hunting and gathering  and sang songs, recited poems and stories, orated genealogies and sagas. Now we sit on our couch-potato asses and let others entertain us. We pay those who used to sit around the fire singing with us, outrageous sums of money because they sing better than anyone else.
We've been turned into dumb _consumers_ of Art instead of active _participants_. We see only what's "available" on the screens in front of us. A big part of our humanity has been hacked off, air dried, like jerky , put in attractive packaging, and SOLD back to us.
