### The Width, Depth and Breadth




###### ©2020 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com, WritersClass.net






The width, depth and breadth of America —







Of American hearts — is unplumbable and unspanable.







Her edges may be rocky and tempest-tossed,







Clubbed and shattered by angry political waves,







But the hearts are pure, as the plains are vast, 







And the highways striaght, wide and endless.







One doesn't "drive" them, one inhales them,







Stopping for gas on the edge of tiny towns,







Listening to the talk of mundane daily life,







Of bills, of kids, of aches and pains.







I accelerate back onto the Interstate,







Savoring the experience, hungering for more.
