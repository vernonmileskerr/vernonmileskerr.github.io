### Internecine




###### © 2017 Vernon Miles Kerr


Are all families dysfunctional?

Are any not?

Thanksgiving beckons.

Love draws, but fear impedes.

We go anyway,

Putting away ancient hurts

And hoping for the best —

Hugs and howdies.

The mashed-potatoes go 'round,

Cranberries and turkey too.

We hold our tongues

Until alcohol loosens them

And dinner erupts into brouhaha.

Tears for dessert.
