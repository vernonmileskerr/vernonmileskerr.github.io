## Humanity, the Gamut







Â©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com












    
    Good-hearted nurturing people abound,
    As do parasitic thieving  scoundrels.
    
    While mothers  caress and coo, 
    Whores flaunt their wares downtown.
    
    A caring physician, strokes a fevered brow
    While a Drug Lord in a storied mansion 
    On a storied estate
    Shouts telephonic commands
    To up Oxy production.
    
    An artist  labors and frets 
    to create perfect beauty
    While a smug politician blithely blocks a bill
    To save Art Education.
    
    Sumptious dinners are set out 
    On  legendary tables,
    While dirty, broken-nailed fingers
    Claw through back-alley garbage bins.
    
    Scientists look to the stars,
    While worried parents look to the bills.
    
    This is the gamut of humanity
    Or at least a slice,
    For Reader's consideration
    In moments of chauvanistic pride,
    Laced with human-aggrandizement.
    
    We are not so much of the stars, 
    As we are of the dirt.
    A race of angels cannot be launched
    from a corrupt pad.
    
    The mundane must be minded
    Before mounting the ladder to heaven.
