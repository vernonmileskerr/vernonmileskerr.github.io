# A Fictional First-Person Narrative by God, 3



    
    ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com






  
The fictional God says:  
"Hey, 'Evangelical Christianity'!  
'Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin. You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting!'**  
"You've taken it upon yourselves to 'do me one better' by not allowing the teachings of Yeshua Ben Yosef to propagate purely on merit. 







Instead, you have created a proselytizing religious empire, which I, your God, never intended. Worse, you have tainted whatever good remained within your work with your support for a type of politics which advocates Toxic-Nationalism.  
"Turn away from this path — disfellowship those behind this blasphemy. Return to my fold.







'







"Love,







God"







**Dan. 5:25, KJV
