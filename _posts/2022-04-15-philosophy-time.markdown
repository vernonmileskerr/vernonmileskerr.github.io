excerpt: Einstein said "time" was relative. It was local.  Time for a massive object
  is slower as it was for a faster-moviing object.  Could "Time" just be a construct
  of the human mind?

# Time







###### ©2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com







Time is a construct of the human mind.  The present does not really exist:  it is merely the impossibly thin, hurtling cursor that creates revealed reality.  There is no future, except in human imagination:  what is out beyond the cursor's direction of travel is as opaque as a black granite wall.  There is no past:  there are only artifacts and human memories in the cursor's wake. When there is no more human memory nor human imagination there will be no past, present nor future:  only events with no one to witness them.  Just as it was before humans had the capacity to notice.
