## Humanity's Big Two

[#MorningMeditations](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MorningMeditations?src=hashtag_click) (thread) I'm not a [#politician](https://twitter.com/hashtag/politician?src=hashtag_click), nor a [#theologian](https://twitter.com/hashtag/theologian?src=hashtag_click) — so take this for what it's worth. I'm an [#Agnostic](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Agnostic?src=hashtag_click) who SUSPECTS that there's a supreme intelligence infusing our Universe. So, I pray. Then I get answers — not words...just, realizations. Instant solutions to knotty problems—sometimes—not always. 




This morning I said, "God, what are the two biggest problems facing humans today?" The answer came flooding in immediatedly: 




1. Those writings that humans call "holy books," are not my words. Yes, I inspired them, as I'm inspiring you now. I did not dictate them. There is a lot of THEM in all those writings. I am Love, if it does not reflect Love, it is the "THEM" part. But don't throw the writings out, just use the test. 




2. Your current world is dominated by money;  you misquote me as saying "Money is the root of all evil." Yes, it is A root of much evil and it is the root of the current world-domination by those who have an inordinate and unwarranted amount of it. Find ANOTHER method of rewarding effort: 




STOP rewarding the mere ABILITY to accummulate money.




END TRANSMISSION.....
