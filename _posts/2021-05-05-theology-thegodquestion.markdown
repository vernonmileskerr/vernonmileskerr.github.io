# The God Question




©2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com






_This is another one of those essays incubated on Twitter, @kerr_vernon , then hatched on WordPress.  _







The God Question.  It's the BIG question.  Most of today's world-ugliness is caused by conflicts arising from it.  Survey the news, for the past year, then throw away every conflict and  blood-letting that can't be traced back to #TheGodQuestion and what do you have left?  Just sayin'.







If there's a supreme intelligence in the Universe, is it a creative-force or merely an inspirational, communicative force? We can't see the wind, but we can see its effects. And there are so many mysterious, baffling effects!  Is that supreme-intelligence "trolling" us?  Or does it exercise some kind of "prime-directive" allowing us to develop without interference?  







If it does "inspire" — nothing more — is _that_ considered "interference"?  What about its _allowing_ the ugliness of humanity, or even deadly natural events?  Could that seeming _insouciance_ be some kind of "tough love"?  'Seems like a supreme-intelligence would be rooting for us — but to what end? Our lives are so short. Therefore, do our lives extend beyond the material realm?







If not, all this "experience" is in vain — worthless.
