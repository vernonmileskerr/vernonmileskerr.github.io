## The Word












    
    In OUR beginning was the Word
    As without it, nothing in our Reality-of-Words could exist.
    What is real is what we say.
    We communicate our thoughts with Words
    And because our thoughts are chaotic,
    So are the Words, 
    And the disease of chaos
    Goes virulent and spreads amongst us.
    
    Word's handmaiden is the Lie.
    She clings to Word and is scarce
    Excised by even the sharpest
    Of scholarly, rhetorical scalpels.
    And even then, her seeds lie hidden in folds
    Of Wordly flesh, only to sprout again
    At the briefest moment of inattention.
    
    By The Word, innocents are put to death
    And scoundrels are set free
    Because we have put one hand
    On a book of ancient, shifting Words
    And have sworn that Lady Lie will not
    Be present in ours.
    So the Words spew out, prompted by
    The chaos of Memory —
    And precedent is established from chaos.
