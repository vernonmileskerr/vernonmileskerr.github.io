Give 'Em What They Want







(c) 2022 by Vernon Miles Kerr and VernonMilesKerr.com






    
    Perhaps the world was always thus,
    Like sweet and sour pork,
    Or flaming dog turds on a porch,
    Or things of that import.
    
    The air up there must be sublime,
    Where one does what he pleases,
    Without a care for consequence
    Or COVID-laden sneezes.
    
    "As long as plebes don't sneeze on me,
    I'll agree that masks are tyranny.
    I'll say,  that VAX's are just a hoax,
    Gain votes from their fears of getting pokes."
