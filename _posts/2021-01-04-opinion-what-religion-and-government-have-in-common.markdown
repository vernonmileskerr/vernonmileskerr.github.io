Sometimes a multi-part posting on Twitter turns into a mini essay.   My conclusion on this thread is that the elimination of chaos and uncertainty comes at a price: a giving up of some freedom.  When the trade-off is voluntary and rescindable by voting, then there is good balance, resulting in peace.  When the trade-off is mandatory or voting becomes a meaningless choice between virtually similar political parties, then chaos increases.
