(c) 2016 Vernon Miles Kerr

That Shadow on the Wall,
It just now jumped

From over there to hereâ€”
I must have dozed,
Or maybe I had a brain fart,
As they say.
I know that the old CPU
Ain't what it used to be--
Ain't what it used to be--
Ain't what it used to be--
The old CPU it ain't...
There goes that damned music again.
Every thing becomes a damned song.
