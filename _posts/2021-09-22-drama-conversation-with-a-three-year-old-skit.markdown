## Conversation With a Three Year-old (skit)




* * *






An old man is fiddling with pieces of an old wooden chair in a backyard shop.  His three year-old great grandson strolls up.







KID 







Whatcha doin' Great Grandpa? 







GG







Someone put this old Adirondack Chair out for the trash man. I'm restoring it. 







KID







Why? 







GG







I dunno.   Good question   We've got no room for it anywhere. 







(beat) 







Just for fun I guess.







KID 







You're all sweaty. 







GG 







Yeah, this sanding is hard work. 







KID 







You said you were doing it for fun. 







GG 







Well, work can be fun... 







(beat) 







Work SHOULD be fun. 







KID 







Playing is fun.   Work is boring. 







GG 







(scoffs) 







When have you ever done any work?







KID 







All the time.   I have to pick up my toys.   I've got lottsa toys. It's boring. 







GG 







You like video games, right?   Don't ya have to work to get good at 'em? 







KID 







Sorta.   But it's fun work 







GG 







Why?







KID







You have these levels.   You have to get to the next level.   Sometimes you get zapped! 







GAME OVER! 







But you can startover and... 







GG 







Bingo!   That's the same as work.   Work is a game... 







(beat)







or it _should_ be a game.   You make it a game.   Finishing is the next level.







KID 







Does President Biden work? 







GG 







Sure.   He works at being a politician.   Politics is plenty of work.







KID 







What's politcs?   I know there's lottsa yelling.







GG 







Hmm... 







(beat) 







Good question.   I guess you could say it's a game to decide who gets to spend the country's money and who gets to control the police and the military.







KID 







Wow!   Like World of Warcraft!   I think I wanna be a politician when I grow up. 







GG 







(eye-roll, muttering) 







Oh-my-God, what have I done?
