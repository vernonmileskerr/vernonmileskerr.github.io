# Don't Sweat the Small Stuff




###### ©2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr. com

In law school, we learned a Latin phrase from the old English Common Law:




"De minimis, non curat lex."




(The law doesn't concern itself with trifles) said in context of people bringing lawsuits for trivial grievances, often for the purpose of harassment or vengeance.) I've been thinking recently maybe a human needs to adopt the policy




"De minimis non curat LIFE."  




Quit giving attention to trivial frustrations and disappointments—giving them so much bandwidth.  Look beyond a small frustration toward your big goal or goals.  Don't major in the minors. LIFE doesn’t care if you dropped a bowl and shattered it while washing dishes. LIFE doesn’t care if you were pulled over and given a citation for speeding.  As a clever old saying went:  “In a hundred years, no one will ever know it happened.”
