# The Foolishness of Youth

I just noticed the date: May 23rd. This is an anniversary of sorts, for me. On May 23, 1970, I registered with the State Bar of California as a law student â€“ which under our "Lincoln Law" is required for students studying under a Judge or Attorney or oneattending a non-accredited law school. I had just paid $695 to get an LLB degree from La Salle Extension University in Chicago. An additional requirement of the Lincoln Law is that the registrant must pass a "baby bar exam" covering the subjects of Torts, Con-tracts & Criminal Law. It took me 2 yrs and 2 tries to pass it. With my "good news" letter I went to the Sr. VP of my employer, Bank of Stockton, and applied to get my $695 reimbursed. The next day, I got a call from the President's secretary. "Mr. Eberhardt wouldike to chat with you." Oops, maybe applying for tuition reimbursement was too much of a stretch."Sure, we'll reimburse tuition, but I talked to the dean of OUR law school, McGeorge, J[udge Schaber](https://www.saccourt.ca.gov/locations/downtown.aspx). (Bob Eberhardt was on the Board of Regents of University of the Pacific)







"Gordon recommends you get out of that correspondence nonsense and into a real law school."He handed me a page torn out of his calendar, "Here's the address, he wants to talk to you in his office in Sacramento tomorrow.







Without much in the way of polite introductions, Schaber said, "We'll start you in October, the next LSAT is in December, if you don't get over 500 on it, you're out with no refund of tuition. I was floored. No degree, only 3 yrs of college in liberal arts, no







"Well, you've got enough college, and we like a well-rounded individual, not pre-law students"I passed the LSAT with 613 and made the cut after year 1 (there's a 50% automatic wash-out.)
