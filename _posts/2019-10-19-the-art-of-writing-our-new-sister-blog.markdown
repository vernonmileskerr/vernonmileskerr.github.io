## A Word of Thanks


First of all, Thank you so much for your readership and comments on VernonMilesKerr.com.  I will keep posting my own work, right here, but I have just created a new site which focuses exclusively on the art of writing in English.

The name of this new site is **Writers Class** the link is [https:/writersclass.net.](https://writersclass.net)

Here is the intro to that site:




### Day One, Writers Class







_The world is filled with wanna-be writers, or so it seems. Don’t all those library shelves, overflowing with books, seem intimidating_? There’s a lot of competition out there. Trust me, as a largely un-published writer, I too, get discouraged. But if I were in it for the money I think I would have given up long ago. It’s the love of writing in the English Language and the magic of rhetoric and story-telling that keep me going. There were several things that motivated me to create this new blog, which will be solely devoted to the Art of Writing:



 	
  * Collaborating with anyone who considers themselves a writer.

 	
  * Sharing editing suggestions for any writer, amateur or professional

 	
  * Sharing articles and advice from the thousands of good writing publications out there

 	
  * Developing in my readers the same love and appreciation I feel for the English language and for its rich heritage of literary and _a_rtistic excellence

 	
  * Developing a following of vocal critics of bad writing and sloppy editing, holding the publishing industry’s feet-to-the-fire to stop the trend of economizing on editors and editor salaries, as if there were no moral reason for striving for journalistic and literary excellence. There is a moral reason: it is the requirement to show gratitude for our gift of English, the world’s greatest, richest, most welcoming and most non-chauvanistic tool of expression — ever.


Please go check it out :)  As always comments and "follows" are humbly appreciated.
