### Edelbach's Odyssey Chapters 1 - 11




## CHAPTER 11




### The Plorton Solution

Edelbach was stunned, his little friend from the trip to Arangelle— vaporized!  He approached Grep. “I’m so sorry, my friend, I remember how tough it was when my brother died.”

Dear Reader,

Chapter 11 will be the final "free preview" posting of Edelbach's Odyssey.  I need to bear-down and finish the book, making it available in paperback and Kindle™ very soon.  To participate in "crowd funding" for the paperback edition and receive a personally autographed copy, send an email and I will reply with PayPal information.  The autographed, first edition will be $19.95 but that will include California Sales Tax AND free shipping.  Thank you so much for following our cranky old hero's weird odyssey.   VMK
