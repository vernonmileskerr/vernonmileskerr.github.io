## Scolding




###### ©2021 by Vernon Miles Kerr, VernonMilesKerr.com





    
    Scolding isn’t  instructing
    Neither is it mentoring,
    No matter how needful
    The recipient.
    
    Scolding doesn’t inspire
    But secretly infuriates;
    It constipates growth,
    Withers self-worth.
    
    Scolding’s intonation is downward,
    Like the one for alarm:
    “Look out!”
    “STOP!”
    “You asshole!”
    “You smoke too much!”
    
    Scolding's tone is never calm and humble,
    But always sharp and proud.
    Its purpose is to force compliance
    Not to secure agreement.
    
    So, though Scolding is ineffective
    It is still resorted to —
    Thinking it a quick-fix.
    
    And even if Scolding fails,
    It still feels good to the scolder.
