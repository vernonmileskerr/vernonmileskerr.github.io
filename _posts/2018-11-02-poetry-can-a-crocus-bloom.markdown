## **Can a Crocus Bloom …**




###### © 2018 Vernon Miles Kerr


Can a crocus bloom in desert’s searing sand;

Or Altruism spring from our primate-surly band?

Could Love, that _agape _of old, that outward-flowing care

For others, arise from merely wishing it so?

Or was it a gift, bestowed by the loving hands,

Of some gardener, long ago;

A seed, planted in unlikely soil,

So that when it flourished

It would confound–

And astonish?
