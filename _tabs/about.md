I'm a former Worship Leader and Lay-Pastor Candidate of a Fundamentalist, Bible-believing church. When the church changed its doctrines in one fell-swoop, I began a quest to learn why there were so MANY Bible-believing churches who all thought the Bible said something drastically different from what the other Bible-believing churches thought that it said.

Now I'm seeking God elsewhere, outside the context of the Bible — more in-tune with my Native American roots.

But this is not to say that God isn't somewhere in the traditional Holy Bible. Many of its contributors were no doubt, inspired.

If nothing else, the Bible is one of the greatest compilations of ancient literature in the world. I find it sad that certain extremists who get lots of press these days have sullied the Bible so much with their actions and opinions, that liberal academia, atheists and agnostics totally reject it as literature.

In my upcoming book, "The Bible | A modern perspective" I hope to change that. 

I'm not building a church. I'm not out to steal members from existing churches. But I think a modern perspective might help some Christians be happier where they are. The fact that having knowledge of various indigenous spiritual methods of reaching God in prayer should not violate church doctrines—except in the most extremely fundamentalist denominations (like the one I was in.) In that church, you had to accept every word of the church's doctrine or you were "disfellowshipped." Excommunicated. Ghosted. "My way or the highway."

In other words I was in a cult, and maybe better off leaving, as I finally did.
