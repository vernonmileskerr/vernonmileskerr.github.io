" I'm a former Worship Leader and Lay-Pastor Candidate of a 'Fundamentalist,' bible-believeing church.  When the church  changed its doctrines in one fell-swoop, I began a quest to learn why there were so MANY 'Bible-Believing'  churches who all thought  the Bible said something drastically differeent from what the other 'Bible-Believing' churches thought that it said.

Now I'm seeking God elsewhere, outside the context of the Bibleâ€” more in-tune with my Native American roots."
